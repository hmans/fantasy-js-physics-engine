### What is this?

This is a JavaScript Physics Engine that does not (yet?) exist.

### Features

- Authored in TypeScript
- Support for 3D and 2D
- Supports fixed and variable steps
- Tree-shakable
- Provides "light" and "heavy" exports, so the same library can be used for "web experiences" that favor a smaller bundle size and don't need some of the more advanced features, but also games, where bundle size isn't as important.
